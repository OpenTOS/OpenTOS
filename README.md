#OpenToS / The Open TOS Project

The goal of this project and repository is to develop a free and open Terms of Service documents in the Finnish language (and optionally in other languages).

Most open source web applications come with a long and complex Terms of Service template document, that is based on the U.S. legistlation and in english language. In order to fully understand these terms, one must have very high level of competence in english language and on the other hand they are troublesome to translate into foreign languages.

The document license should will be CC BY 4.0, which provides a lot of freedom to use, distribute and modify the document, but requires an attribution back to the origin - here.

The idea is that in order to generate any momentum for this project, it needs to brought to the attention of people, thus a link back is beneficial.
